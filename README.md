# Incident Report Analysis: Responding to a DDoS Attack

## Overview
This repository provides an analysis of a **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attack that impacted a multimedia company. The attack compromised the company's internal network, disrupting operations for two hours. The company responded by applying principles from the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** to mitigate the incident and strengthen its security measures.

The NIST CSF is a widely used framework that helps organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risks by guiding them through key steps like identifying vulnerabilities, protecting assets, detecting potential threats, responding to security events, and recovering from incidents.

## Scenario
In this case, a malicious actor exploited an unconfigured firewall to flood the company's network with ICMP packets, causing internal traffic to be halted. The company's cybersecurity team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, stopping non-critical network services, and restoring critical services. To prevent future attacks, several additional security measures were implemented.

## Included Files
1. **Incident report analysis.pdf**: This document contains report analysis of the DDoS attack, including the security measures implemented by the company in response to the incident.
2. **Applying the NIST CSF.pdf**: This resource explains the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and provides guidance on how to apply its core principles to cybersecurity incidents.
3. **Completed Example of an Incident report analysis.pdf**: This file serves as an example of a completed incident report using the NIST CSF, offering a model to follow when documenting and responding to cybersecurity events.

## Conclusion
This repository provides a comprehensive look at how to effectively respond to a security incident using the NIST CSF. By following this approach, organizations can improve their ability to handle and recover from cybersecurity threats, while also strengthening their defenses against future attacks.
